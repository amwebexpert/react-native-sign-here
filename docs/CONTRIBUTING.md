## Code Style

Adhering to established coding guidelines is essential for developing efficient, maintainable, and scalable software. These guidelines promote consistency across codebases, making it easier for teams to collaborate and for new developers to understand existing code. By following standardized patterns, such as those outlined in the [Coding guidelines](https://github.com/amwebexpert/chrome-extensions-collection/blob/master/packages/coding-guide-helper/public/markdowns/table-of-content.md), developers can reduce errors and enhance code readability.

* [Coding guidelines](https://github.com/amwebexpert/chrome-extensions-collection/blob/master/packages/coding-guide-helper/public/markdowns/table-of-content.md)


### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow strict TypeScript configuration
- Provide proper type definitions
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Prefer `const` over `let` when possible

### React/React Native

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React naming conventions
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
- Keep components focused and reusable

### File Structure

- Follow the existing project structure
- Place new components in `src/components/`
- Place utilities in `src/utils/`
- Place types in `src/types/`
- Update `src/index.ts` for new exports

### Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components and types
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use Jest and React Native Testing Library
- Test both success and error cases
- Aim for good test coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage

# Run specific test file
yarn test path/to/test-file.test.ts
```
